# aiosonic

Async http client

This project is in alpha state. Here is some [documentation](https://sonic182.github.io/aiosonic/html/index.html).

There is a performance script in tests folder which shows very nice numbers

```
Â» python tests/performance.py
doing tests...
{
 "aiohttp": "1000 requests in 471.06 ms",
 "requests": "1000 requests in 2298.61 ms",
 "aiosonic": "1000 requests in 206.83 ms",
 "aiosonic cyclic": "1000 requests in 241.14 ms"
}
aiosonic is 127.76% faster than aiohttp
aiosonic is 1011.37% faster than requests
aiosonic is 16.59% faster than aiosonic cyclic  # Using non standard pool of connections
